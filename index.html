        <p>That's right. When I was your
            age, television was called books.
            And this is a special book. It
            was the book my father used to
            read to me when I was sick, and I
            used to read it to your father.
            And today, I'm gonna read it to
            you.</p>
        <p>Has it got any sports in it?</p>
        <p>  Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
            Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.
            Chases. Escapes. True love.
            Miracles.</p>
